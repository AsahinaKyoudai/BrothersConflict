![Cover](image/readme_main.jpg)

**Brothers Conflict: Precious Baby** is an otome game developed by Otomate that was first released on PS Vita on 4/7/2016. It combines both Passion Pink and Brilliant Blue, which were previously released on PSP on 5/17/2012 and 9/12/2013 respectively. It has since been ported to the Nintendo Switch on 8/29/2019.

**Brilliant Blue**: Ukyo, Azusa, Louis, Iori, Wataru & Natsume Routes<br/>
**Passion Pink**: Masaomi, Kaname, Hikaru, Tsubaki, Subaru, Yusuke & Fuuto Routes<br/>
*There are some secret routes/endings as well!*

This fan localization patch is for the PS Vita version of the game.

### PLEASE NOTE THE BELOW

#### BUGS ðŸ˜”

* **There is still one major bug with Kaname's route where some of the translations for the overnight stay events do not show up. As we were unable to fix this bug, we will be releasing scripts for the overnight stay events. The scripts can be accessed [here](https://github.com/AsahinaKyoudai/BrothersConflict/blob/c84701d25b869cf8f742c69abdc7fea68a4ed63d/Kaname_Overnight%20Stay%20Scripts_20220101.pdf).**
* **Event names either show up in Japanese or do not show up at all. Unfortunately, translating them caused some events not to trigger.**

#### QA / Error Submission

* Many contributors have worked on this project throughout the years. The project was revived about two years ago, and since then, our Japanese and English proofreaders have been diligently scrubbing through all scripts to ensure an accurate and consistent translation. As such, some scripts have been heavily edited from the original translations in our patch. Our team has also translated the remainder of the Passion Pink and Brilliant Blue scripts.
* This is a fan localization done by passionate volunteers. Although our team did a second proofread of all existing scripts and even retranslated some, we were unable to do Japanese proofreading for every single script due to bandwidth, especially for the Passion Pink scripts by [**Passion & Brilliance**](https://passionandbrilliance.tumblr.com/).
* Please be patient with us if you do spot any issues, and we hope you contribute to this patch by reporting the errors through our [**Error Submission Form**](https://forms.gle/3QtQBDKY1bXoJFvf8)!
*Please note that you must have a Google account to access this form due to Google requirements on image uploads.*

### FAQ

Here is our current list of FAQ questions! We will keep adding to the FAQ list here as we get more inquiries about the patch.

#### What do I need to play the game?

* A hacked PS Vita with sufficient storage space for the patch (~3 GB)
* A copy of the game (**PS Vita version only**)
* A copy of the patch **(Please refer back to this GitHub repository for the latest version.)**
* A Vita-compatible micro USB cable
* A computer/laptop for uploading the patch

#### How does the patch work?

Our patch can only be played with a modded PS Vita and a copy of **Brothers Conflict: Precious Baby**Â¹. You may choose to purchase a device that is already modded, or you can follow a guide for an unmodded device, such as this [PS Vita (TV) Hacks Guide](https://vita.hacks.guide/) or this [Reddit post + guide on VitaDeploy](https://www.reddit.com/r/vitahacks/comments/meg7sp/release_vitadeploy_a_toolbox_that_makes/).

Please note that modding your PS Vita comes with the risk of permanently bricking your device during the process. Although rare, you should understand all risks involved before proceeding and be sure to follow all instructions exactly. Under no circumstances will Otogelib or its community be held responsible or liable in any way for any damages to your device as a result of your own actions.

Instructions on how to patch a PS Vita game can be found [**here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144LNdl8hE2pPmQPyma3l8BSF_47ezorE/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111035187415794645473&rtpof=true&sd=true).

##### Although there is a Nintendo Switch version of Brothers Conflict: Precious Baby, we will only release a patch for the PS Vita version.

*Â¹ Can be either physical or digital. If you are using a sd2vita memory card adapter rather than an official PS Vita memory card, you will be unable to use a physical game card.*

#### Will a walkthrough be available?
We have a detailed walkthrough that we put together for our beta testers that was a translation of a Japanese walkthrough. This is available upon request, but may have some slight differences in-game. If there is enough demand, then we may clean up this copy and release it, or we may consider creating a more general guide.

We highly recommend that you check out the brother profiles in-game for tips on favorite foods/activities and any other brothers that you may need to build a relationship with! Juli's advice on each profile will change throughout the route as well.

We highly encourage walkthroughs if anyone would like to create one in English! If anyone has any questions about routes, game mechanics, etc, then feel free to reach out to us on [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/TeamAsahina)!

#### Will text translations be uploaded?

Not at this time. However, we may consider publishing text translations for Brilliant Blue if there is enough demand.

### SYSTEM

#### Gameplay

The game takes place over one year.

You can change the protagonist's first name. Her default name is Ema Asahina. You can input up to 3 characters.

You can choose between the Passion Pink and Brilliant Blue games on the title screen.

![Game Selection](image/system_gameselection.jpg)

#### Events

Certain events will only occur if the brother is a love interest in that game.

There are events with multiple siblings as well. These events require both brother affection AND family affection. Some events occur in both games, while others only occur in one of the two games.

Choices can increase either brother affection or family affection.

#### Weekly Schedule

In addition to the story and brother events, there's also a simulation system where you can raise affection, earn money, go shopping, and reduce your fatigue.

You have to set your schedule every week. You can choose to spend time with the whole family (increase family affection), with one specific brother (increase brother affection), or by yourself. Additional activities can be selected on weekends and holidays (i.e., dates, overnight stays, shopping).

![Schedule](image/system_schedule.jpg)

#### Dates

You can choose to go on a date on your days off.

##### Brother Date

You can visit your brother's room and invite him on a date. If he accepts, then you can choose to go to the aquarium, zoo, amusement park, shopping mall, movie theater, or park. After a period of time, you'll be able to select his room as a date spot as well.

You'll be given a choice during each date. His affection level may change depending on your answer.

![Date](image/system_date.jpg)

##### Family Date

You can go on a date with the whole family. The brothers that appear are random and may depend on who the love interests are in the version you're playing.

Similar to the brother dates, you can pick between 6 locations. You will also be given a choice during each date. Family affection may change depending on your answer.

#### Overnight Stay

Once certain conditions are met, you'll be able to stay overnight at one of your brother's rooms on your days off. The brothers you can visit depend on who the love interests are for the version you are playing.

When you go to your brother's room, you'll see his mood in the upper left hand corner. Choose between four emotional expressions after considering the brother's personality and his words in order to get him to agree to you staying over! The gauge on the right will increase as you select the correct responses. If you succeed, then you'll be able to view the overnight stay event (the conversation will change depending on affection level).
